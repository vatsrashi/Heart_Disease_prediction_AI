1. Project Description: 
Title: Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
The goal of this project was to apply machine learning and develop a program that can 
predict whether a person is suffering from heart disease or not.
We will be looking into the heart disease dataset from that dataset we will derive various 
insights that help us know the weightage of each feature and how they are interrelated to each 
other but this time our sole aim is to detect the probability of person that will be affected by a 
savior heart problem or not.
2. Problem Statement: 
To predict the chances of heart disease in a patient by implementing different data mining 
techniques such as KNN, Decision Tree and Random Forest on the available dataset. 
3. Analysis 
3.1 Hardware Requirements: 
 PC -Intel i5/i7 or any other compatible processor.
 RAM – 4GB or more
3.2 Software Requirements: 
 Windows 7 or newer.
 Jupyter notebook- Python.
 Dataset for the analysis.
 Stable internet connection.
4. Design: 
Takeaways: 
The Heart Disease prediction will have the following key takeaways:
Data insight: As mentioned here we will be working with the heart disease detection dataset 
and we will be putting out interesting inferences from the data to derive some meaningful 
results.
EDA: Exploratory data analysis is the key step for getting meaningful results.
Feature engineering: After getting the insights from the data we have to alter the features so 
that they can move forward for the model building phase.
Model building: In this phase, we will be building our Machine learning model for heart 
disease detection.
Algorithms used: 
1.KNN- It is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to make 
classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point.


2. Decision trees- Decision Tree is a Supervised learning technique that can be used for both 
classification and Regression problems. We used Cat Boost-It is an algorithm for gradient 
boosting on decision tree.
3. Random Forest- Random Forest is a popular machine learning algorithm that belongs to 
the supervised learning technique. It can be used for both Classification and Regression 
problems in ML. It is based on the concept of ensemble learning.
